# How to Check Land Deeds (Sinnakkara vs Bimsaviya) in Sri Lanka

> **Key Takeaways:**
> *   **Sinnakkara (Freehold):** The traditional deed system. Requires a 30-year "Pedigree" check to verify ownership.
> *   **Bimsaviya (Title Registration):** State-guaranteed title. Safest against fraud but coverage is currently limited.
> *   **Verification is Crucial:** Never pay an advance without verifying the "Folio Extracts" at the Land Registry.
> *   **Expert Advice:** Always use a specialized Notary Public for land transactions.

If you are looking to **buy land in Sri Lanka**, understanding the legal documentation is your first line of defense against fraud. The real estate market is booming, but so are land disputes. The two terms you will hear most often are **"Sinnakkara"** and **"Bimsaviya"**.

But what is the actual difference? Is one better than the other? And most importantly, how can you ensure your investment is safe? In this 2025 guide, we provide a comprehensive breakdown of Sri Lankan land deeds, authorized verification methods, and expert tips for safe property investment.

## 1. What is a "Sinnakkara" (Freehold) Deed?

**Sinnakkara** (Sinhala for "Absolute Ownership") is the traditional system of land registration in Sri Lanka, governed primarily by the *Registration of Documents Ordinance*. Under this system, the **Deed** is the primary legal instrument composed by a Notary Public.

### How it Works
In the Sinnakkara system, the "Chain of Title" or **Pedigree** is everything. To prove you own the land, you must show a sequence of deeds transferring ownership from one person to another for at least **30 to 35 years**.

*   **Pros:** Harmonizes with historical records; widely accepted for properties with a long family history; covers the majority of land in Sri Lanka.
*   **Cons:** Vulnerable to forgery; difficult to verify if a deed is missing from the chain; boundaries are often described vaguely (e.g., "North by the Coconut Tree").

> **⚠️ Expert Warning:** Most banks in Sri Lanka require a clear "30-year Title Search" (Paththiru search) to grant a mortgage loan on a Sinnakkara deed. If even one page is missing from the Land Registry records from 20 years ago, your loan could be rejected.

## 2. What is a "Bimsaviya" Deed?

Introduced under the *Registration of Title Act No. 21 of 1998*, **Bimsaviya** is a modern **Title Registration** system. This system moves away from "Deed Registration" to "Title Registration," similar to the Torrens title system used in Australia and Singapore.

### How it Works
Under Bimsaviya, the government surveys the land, resolves any boundary disputes, and issues a **Certificate of Title**. This certificate is state-guaranteed proof of ownership.

*   **Pros:** **State-guaranteed ownership** (the government compensates you if there is an error); boundaries are GPS synced; virtually impossible to forge; banks process loans instantly.
*   **Cons:** The rollout is slow. Only specific districts and "Bimsaviya Zones" have been fully converted.

### Quick Comparison: Sinnakkara vs. Bimsaviya

| Feature | Sinnakkara (Deed Registration) | Bimsaviya (Title Registration) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Document** | The Deed (Attested by Notary) | Title Certificate (Issued by Registrar) |
| **Proof of Ownership** | 30-Year Pedigree (History) | The Certificate itself |
| **Boundaries** | Verbal descriptions (vague) | Cadastral Map (GPS Precise) |
| **Dispute Resolution** | District Court (Lengthy) | Commissioner of Title |
| **Bank Loans** | Slow (Needs Title Report) | Fast (Instant Verification) |

## 3. How to Check if a Land Deed is Genuine (E-E-A-T Guide)

Whether you are buying a perch in **Colombo**, **Gampaha**, or **Kandy**, following a strict verification process is essential. Do not rely on the seller's word.

### Step 1: Request the "Folio Extract" (Paththiru)
Go to the relevant Land Registry (e.g., Delkanda, Homagama, Avissawella) and apply for the certified extracts for the last 30 years.
*   **What to look for:** Continuity. Does Owner A sell to Owner B? If Owner A sells to Owner B, but then Owner A sells to Owner C 5 years later, you have a problem.

### Step 2: Verify the Surveyor Plan
Every deed refers to a "Plan". Ensure the plan number, date, and surveyor's name match the deed references.
*   **Street Line Certificate:** Obtain this from the local municipal council. It confirms that your land is not earmarked for future road widening projects.

### Step 3: Check for "Life Interests"
A "Life Interest" (Praveniya) gives someone (usually a parent) the right to live on the property until their death. This is often written in small print. You cannot evict them even if you buy the land.

### Step 4: Use the "e-Land Registry"
The [Registrar General's Department](https://www.rgd.gov.lk) has launched an online portal. While not 100% comprehensive yet, it is a great tool for preliminary checks in digitized zones.

## 4. Common Land Frauds in Sri Lanka (And How to Avoid Them)

### The "Identical Deed" Scam
Fraudsters obtain a certified copy of a real deed (which anyone can do) and then create a fake ID matching the owner's name. They then "sell" the land to an unsuspecting buyer.
*   **Prevention:** Always visit the land. Talk to the **Grama Niladhari** (Village Officer) and neighbors. They know who the real owner is.

### The "Power of Attorney" Trap
Buying land from someone holding a Power of Attorney (POA) is risky. The original owner may have revoked the POA, or the POA might be forged.
*   **Prevention:** Insist on contacting the principal owner directly, even via video call if they are abroad.

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I convert a Sinnakkara deed to Bimsaviya?**
A: You cannot do this individually. The government declares specific areas as "Adjudication Zones" and converts all lands in that area systematically.

**Q: Is it safe to buy land without a Title Report?**
A: Absolutely not. A Title Report from a reputable lawyer is the minimum requirement for any transaction.

**Q: How much are the legal fees?**
A: Typically 1% of the total transaction value for the Notary, plus Stamp Duty (3-4%). Use our [Stamp Duty Calculator](/blog/stamp-duty-legal-fees-buying-land) to estimate costs.

## Conclusion

Understanding the difference between **Sinnakkara** and **Bimsaviya** is critical for any real estate investor in Sri Lanka. While Bimsaviya offers superior security, a properly verified Sinnakkara deed is a solid asset.

**Your Action Plan:**
1.  Verify the Pedigree (30 Years).
2.  Check the Survey Plan.
3.  Consult a specialized Land Lawyer.
