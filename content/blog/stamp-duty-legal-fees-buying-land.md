# Understanding Stamp Duty and Legal Fees When Buying Land in Sri Lanka (2025)

> **Key Takeaways:**
> *   **Total "Hidden" Costs:** Expect to pay **5-6%** on top of the land price.
> *   **Stamp Duty:** 3% for the first Rs. 100,000, and **4%** for the remainder.
> *   **Legal Fees:** Standard rate is **1%** of the transaction value.
> *   **Penalty:** Failing to pay Stamp Duty on time attracts massive fines.

When budgeting for a land purchase, most people focus solely on the negotiated price of the land. They often forget the "closing costs"—the mandatory taxes and professional fees required to legally transfer ownership.

These extra costs can amount to hundreds of thousands of rupees. In this guide, we provide a complete breakdown of **Stamp Duty**, **Legal Fees**, and **Registration Charges** effective in 2025.

## 1. Stamp Duty (The Government Tax)

Stamp Duty is a revenue tax payable to the Provincial Council where the land is located. It is the single largest "hidden" cost in any real estate transaction.

### How is it Calculated?
Stamp Duty is calculated on the **Declared Value** of the deed OR the **Government Valuation**, whichever is higher.
*   **First Rs. 100,000 of value:** Taxed at **3%**.
*   **Balance Value:** Taxed at **4%**.

### The Calculation Example 🧮
Let's assume you are buying a land plot for **Rs. 10 Million (1 Crores)**.

1.  **First 100k:** 100,000 x 3% = **Rs. 3,000**
2.  **Remaining 9.9M:** 9,900,000 x 4% = **Rs. 396,000**
3.  **Total Stamp Duty:** **Rs. 399,000**

> **⚠️ Important:** You usually cannot pay this in cash at the Land Registry. It acts as a direct bank deposit or pay order to the Provincial Council.

## 2. Lawyer's / Notary's Fees

In Sri Lanka, a deed is only valid if attested by a Notary Public. The Notary (usually your lawyer) charges a fee for:
1.  Checking the Title (Pedigree).
2.  Drafting the new Deed.
3.  Attesting the signature and handling registration.

*   **Standard Rate:** The Bar Association of Sri Lanka guidelines suggest roughly **1%** of the transaction value.
*   **Negotiation:** For very high-value properties (e.g., 50 Million+), lawyers may agree to a lower percentage (e.g., 0.5% - 0.75%).
*   **Minimum Fee:** For very small values, lawyers may have a minimum fixed fee (e.g., Rs. 25,000).

> **Example:** For the same Rs. 10 Million land, Legal Fees would be approx **Rs. 100,000**.

## 3. Land Registry Fees

After signing, the deed must be registered to make it public record.
*   **Registration Fee:** A nominal fee (approx Rs. 500 - 1,000).
*   **Search Fees:** Expenses for obtaining extracts (Paththiru) to check the history. Usually Rs. 2,000 - 5,000 depending on how many years back you check.

## 4. Total Closing Cost Calculator

So, if you buy a land for **Rs. 10 Million**, how much extra cash do you need?

| Cost Item | Estimated Amount |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stamp Duty** | Rs. 399,000 |
| **Legal Fees (1%)** | Rs. 100,000 |
| **Admin/Reg/Search Fees** | Rs. 10,000 |
| **TOTAL EXTRA COST** | **Rs. 509,000** |

**Conclusion:** You need roughly **5.1% extra** cash in hand.

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Who pays the Stamp Duty?**
A: Legally, the **Buyer** pays the Stamp Duty and Legal Fees. The Seller usually pays the Broker's commission (3%).

**Q: Can I undervalue the deed to save tax?**
A: This is illegal and risky. If the Land Registry determines the declared value is lower than the market value, they will impose a penalty and force you to pay the deficit. Also, "undervaluing" hurts you when you sell later, as you will face higher Capital Gains Tax exposure (if implemented).

**Q: When must I pay?**
A: Stamp Duty must be paid *before* or *on the day* of signing the deed.
