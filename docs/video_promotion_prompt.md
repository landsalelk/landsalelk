## Video Concept: "From Struggle to Success"

### Scene 1: The Struggle (Traditional Method)
**Visual:**  
A young real estate agent (Nimal) is sitting at a messy desk, looking tired. He is making cold calls from a phone book. The lighting is dim/cool blue. He looks frustrated.

**Audio (Background):**  
Busy street noise, ticking clock.

**Dialog (Sinhala):**  
*Nimal (on phone):* "ආයුබෝවන් සර්, ඔබතුමා ඉඩමක් ගන්න බලාපොරොත්තු වෙනවද?"  
*(Hello Sir, are you hoping to buy a land?)*

*Voice on Phone (Angry):* "නෑ නෑ, මට වද දෙන්න එපා!"  
*(No no, don't bother me!)*  
*[Phone cuts off]*

*Nimal (Sighs):* "හැමදාම මෙහෙමයි... එක Client කෙනෙක් හොයාගන්න කොච්චර අමාරුද?"  
*(It's like this every day... How hard is it to find one client?)*

### Scene 2: The Solution (Discovery)

A successful-looking friend (Kamal) walks in. He looks fresh, wearing a smart casual outfit. He sees Nimal.

**Dialog (Sinhala):**  
*Kamal:* "මොකද මචං, මූණ එල්ලාගෙන?"  
*(What's up machan, why the long face?)*

*Nimal:* "Business නෑ බං. කෝල් ගත්තට කවුරුත් කැමති නෑ."  
*(No business man. Even if I call, no one is interested.)*

*Kamal (Smiling):* "උඹ තාම පරණ විදියටද වැඩ කරන්නේ? මම දැන් පාවිච්චි කරන්නේ **landsale.lk**."  
*(Are you still working the old way? I'm using landsale.lk now.)*

**Dialog (Sinhala):**

*(Here we don't need to run after them. Clients come looking for us.)*

*Kamal (Pointing to screen):* "බලන්න, මේ **Banner Agent** feature එක. මගේ Profile එක site එකේ උඩින්ම පෙන්නනවා. අලුත් buyers ලා කෙලින්ම මට කතා කරනවා."  
*(Look, this Banner Agent feature. My profile shows up at the top of the site. New buyers call me directly.)*
